Getting Started (Local setup)

This project has:

a frontend (React + TypeScript)

a PHP API (served separately)

a MySQL database

You’ll need a local web server environment (Apache/Nginx + PHP + MySQL).
I used Laragon, but XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP works too.

1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dzsepetto/OnlineGames.git
cd OnlineGames


2) Start a local MySQL server

Create a database for the project (example name: onlinegames).

If you already have a schema/dump, import it into that database.
(If not: it’s worth adding a docs/schema.sql later so contributors can bootstrap instantly.)

3) Configure environment variables (.env.local)

Create a file called .env.local (in the frontend project folder you use for running the app) and set your DB connection values.

Example:

DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=onlinegames
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=


If you’re using Laragon, DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 and DB_USER=root is usually fine.

4) Deploy the PHP API to your local web server

The frontend calls the API through your local server, so the api folder must be served by Apache/Nginx.

Typical Laragon example:

put the api folder into something like:

C:\laragon\www\api (or a project subfolder like C:\laragon\www\onlinegames\api)

After that, you should be able to open something like:

http://localhost/api/... (depending on your folder name / virtual host)

5) Point the frontend to the local API (recommended)

If you have an API base URL in config/env, set it to your local endpoint, for example:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/api


(Use whatever variable name the project expects — the idea is: frontend → local API.)

6) Run the frontend

Install dependencies and start the dev server (in the frontend folder):

npm install
npm run dev


If your frontend lives in a subfolder (common in this repo layout), run the commands inside that folder.
